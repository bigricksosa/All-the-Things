Introducing All the Things! At well over 200 mods, this pack aims to feel like one of the FTB/Technic mega-packs from back in the day.

Includes most modern performance enhancing mods like Embeddium, as well as having many QoL features such as MouseTweaks and Borderless Fullscreen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compatibility 
Combine multiple ecosystems with the addition of compatibility mods! While there may be overlapping content, every technical mod in the pack can be utilized with one another.

As more content is added, I will also try my best to add in custom config files to further improve mod compatibility, if necessary.

For now, the pack offers a good middle-ground between sticking to one mod environment and mixing multiple together.
